    The web is: more like water than television;
    our ecosystem;
    shared external memory;
    a place where art meets puzzles.

    The web is: made of ideas, not content;
    our project;
    misunderstood by most of us;
    woven far deeper than we can imagine.

    The web is: a common information space;
    our target;
    ready for our full potential;
    a bizarre miracle of human cooperation.

    The web is: a history and a heritage;
    our myth;
    still just some HTML;
    total trash and we are raccoons.

    The web is: a work of art;
    our mess;
    more than a mouse and keyboard;
    an infinite library seeking librarians.

    The web is: a simulation;
    our path;
    a home and a trap;
    some software but not all software.

    The web is: where we gather;
    our soil;
    meant for experiments;
    the operating system for humankind.

    The web is: an edifice built upon sand;
    our lives;
    a place to define a destiny;
    almost ready, we just need to add one more page.
